Up to this lesson, the course has been relatively easy. I have had short moments of getting stuck in a few exercises, but have been able to solve the situation by utilizing the HTML elements reference site. This has been the most important skill I have learned so far. I did not know if this site and in the few past experiences with HTML, I have use general Google searches to find these kind of answers. I think this will save me a lot of time. 

Additionally, I learned how to deal with images, something I have not done in the past.
